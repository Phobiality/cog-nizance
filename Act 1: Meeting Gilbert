[Side notes & Questions]:

~The /Meeting Gilbert/ act is NOT to be the first act within the game, as there should be venturing within the world of the RPG n order to get a feel for mechanics, receive starter items, and possibly incorporate side plot if wanted/needed. /Meeting Gilbert/ will be the first big mission that the player will face.

 ~ Would voice acting and/or an OST be a worthy investment into the RPG?

~ Would two artistic media being incorporated into the visual facet of the game make it more immersive?

~ Should there be a more cooperative atmosphere revolving around the conception and creation of this game involving the party as a whole?

~ Can others be introduced to aiding in the conception/creation of this RPG if interested?

~Will a sprite animator be needed for the successful visual mechanics of this RPG?

~ Cryptic messages interlaced within story will lead to either side plot or main plot later on—if found unmanageable, withdrawal of certain elements such as this is understandable (preferably agreed upon by means of team effort)

~~Meeting Gilbert:~~

/Dialect in form of boxes/:

(Box 1): Ashira tenaciously plants one foot at a time atop chunks of asphalt that crumpled at the base of a half deteriorated facility.

(Box 2): Upon traversing within, a faint aroma of chemicals welcomes Ashira’s nostrils. The scent is bittersweet—it quarrels between settling on registering to Ashira as a potent sting or a cool chill to her senses.

(Box 3): Ashira finds herself having stumbled into a room surrounded by  stacks upon stacks of official looking paperwork. Amid it all, a child seems to be adrift within a sleep chamber.

(Box 4:) Ashira examines the machine intently, and runs a finger over a brass plating with a simple engravement within it: /Experiment 3.1.18.5/

(Box 5): Ashira: “...”

(Box 6): After intently observing the gentle drifting movement of the child, Ashira finds her fingers brush over a red button that reads “Release”

(Box 7): The time ceasing liquid within the chamber slowly proceeds to drain, and the glass encasing rolls down in suite.

(Box 8): ???: “... Why”

(Box 9): Ashira is taken aback by the child rebounding after an Awakening so quickly. It seems that this small child snapped into coherence nearly straight away with precise unwavering tone.

(Box 10): ???: “Why did you release me from my slumber?”

(Box 11): To Ashira’s shock, the stranger’s voice was weighed heavily in a tone that seemed to extend millennia beyond her years of comprehension in a laughably innocent child-like octave in accord with her physique 

(Box 12): Ashira: “...”

(Box 13): Ashira: “I... What’re you going on about? Don’t you want to be free?”

(Box 14): ???: “Free in a world like this?”
> {1} (“...”)
	{2} (“It’s not as bad as you’d think.”)

(Box 15)
>< {1} (???: “That’s what I thought...”)
	{2} (???: “I take it you bat a blind eye to the corruption of humanity.”)

(Box 16): (Ashira: “...”)

(Box 17): (???: “You’re one of them, aren’t you?”)

(Box 18): Ashira: “Them...Oh, uh... No. You see, my name’s Ashira, and—”

(Box 19): (Ashira cautiously plants a foot before her, aiming to comfortingly step forward to melt the whole bitter introduction into a much more gentle place.)

[AS] = /“???” Pipes a stubborn grunt in noting Ashira attempting to step closer and with impossibly  rapid reflexes unsheathes a long slightly slender silvery tube/

(Box 20):  (The child tightly grasps a large dented pipe in hand, posing in a defensive stance)

[AS] = /Ashira recoils her foot and fans her hands out before her in defense/

(Box 21): Ashira: “Listen... I don’t know who /they/ are, but... I do know that it’s too dangerous to be here. We need to leave.”

(Box 22): ???: “You know with great precision to the matter in mind”

(Box 23): (??? Squints her eyes into slivers overflowing with suspicion)

(Box 24): ???: “You’re one of the many that deem themselves to be God—a cruel and relentless one at that.”

(Box 25): ???: “You wouldn’t know this after you flicked those damned fluorescent lights off, but... Once stowing me away into one of those awful prison cells, I would have no one to wipe away my agonized tears...”

(Box 26): Ashira: “That’s not what I stand by, you don’t under—“

(Box 27): (??? Cocks her head to the side, revealing one large sappy eye void of emotion but intensely weighing guilt on Ashira’s shoulders as if she truly /had/ done something wrong)

(Box 28): ???: “You robbed me of my memories. Took me away from wherever I belonged to perform those terrible experiments on me... And for what?”

(Box 29): (??? Looks to have a flame stoking within her singular eye)

(Box 30): ???: “You knew... /The Mutant Mutiny/ would ultimately a lead to failure from the beginning... It was all an attempt to show the opposing side that you were better, stronger, and had technology far more advanced than mere machines.”

(Box 31): (??? Let her head fall as Ashira caught a glimpse of emotion for a split second. A sniffle is audibly heard from the now quivering small frame of the experiment)

(Box 32): Ashira: “I know. I know this is hard—I may not have gone through what you have, but... Let me just say,  I agree with you... Humanity went way out of line and for what...?”

(Box 33): Ashira: “...”

(Box 34): Ashira: “But the past is the past now. There’s nothing we can do to change the corruption that is laden in the path we shed.”

(Box 35): Ashira: “However, there is something that we can do... The good will prevail if we can just find it in our own beings to grace upon the world... There’s still a flicker of hope to change things.”

(Box 36): (??? Slowly raises her head again, and this time manages a sorrow filled smile)

(Box 37): ???: “Heh... Sounds like you have it all figured out for yourself. Unfortunately for me, I’ve come to terms long ago with one thing...”

(Box 38): ???: “...”

(Box 39): ???: “History should never be repeated ever again...”

[AS] = /??? Pulls out a little remote from her pocket, and a few tiny tincture vials tumbled out, shattering on the floor to let their contents pool around their shattered remains/

(Box 40): (It seems as though the experiment had rummaged through the lab and pocketed things she sought useful prior to enduring cryogenic sleep)

(Box 41): (??? Presses one of the many buttons featured on the little remote and the metallic sheets below the lab proceed to rumble)

[AS] = /The rusty metallic sheets of flooring shake and tear away to an inky abyss that both ??? And Ashira fall into, leading to a fading out screen which loads into the lower level of the laboratory/

[AS] = /Game screen is black with background ambience. A white dialect with whatever set hotkey to open inventory appears. Once inventory is open, a blinking backdrop highlight encases a flashlight that the player picked up in a crumpling building prior to entering this Act while feeling out mechanics/

[AS] = /Ashira turns on flashlight, sitting and rubbing at the side of her head/

(Box 41): Ashira (in small gray letters): “Hnng... I must’ve been out cold for a while...”

[AS] = /Ashira gets to her feet and the player is now free to walk around, though the flashlight is limited to a small beam in illuminating the room, only revealing so much at a time/

[AS] = /The player can interact with old document folders and such, in which different recordings of other failed experiments on children lie/

———————

[For documents discovered & next phase of Act]:

(Box 1): /Experiment 19.6.8.9 (Day 234): 12. seems docile after the routine of tranquilization. The gills have fully developed on 167’s cervical region, the faintly purple tinted webbing has expanded between each finger. Such may be useful in the future, but this isn’t ensured.

(Box 2): /Experiment  1.7.10.12(Day 543): 7. Has been rejecting water as a whole. Dehydration is notable in the life form of said experiment, as water is a harmful element against the constant flammable abilities she contains. 7.’s death due to this seemingly unfixable error would not be surprising. 

(Box 3): /Experiment  22.14.2.7 (Day 1004): 4. Remains to stay amid the shadows of his cell. Light causes harm to 4., and upon shining any light around the milky white optics of said experiment causes a state of temporary blindness. 

(Box 4): /Experiment 5.6.2.3 (Day 1560): 5. Has gone terribly wrong. The original aim for granting 5. With the ability to display super human strength has given 5. Impossibly bloated limbs that resemble muscle. However, these limbs prove to be too big for 5.’s frail physique to burden, rendering him immobile and furthermore useless.

(Box 5): /Experiment 21.23.16.4 (Day 2067): 21. Has grown ears bigger than the average human—measured roughly estimated to be a foot in height and half a foot in width. 21. Is contained within a sound proof chamber, and no one is allowed within her domain due to the smallest of sounds causing major discomfort to 21.. 

(Box 6): /Experiment 19.8.22.2 (Day 2456): 19. Is pacing her cage. She has consumed pounds upon pounds of raw meat, and her hair resembles a scruffy mane rather than the well groomed pigtails she previously sported. She has completely dismantled any little machine we’ve sent in to study her, proving to be highly hostile. Her death may be beneficial to our safety if she proves to not submit to our demands to save us from the Only Solution.

(Box 7): Ashira: “...Disgusting.”

[AS] = /Ashira stumbles upon a desk with childish drawings and a single note/

(Box 8): Ashira: “... The writing is childish and hard to read.”

(Box 9): /Documents...Numbers... Alphabet... Decode.../

[AS] = /With wandering around the room, Ashira is able to pick up a rusty pipe. This is wielded in her hand as a weapon/

[AS] = /More wandering into an office branching to the side of the room that opens only after reading all the documents. In this room, there’s a big old desk that can be searched in which the player receives a key card/

[AS] = /Upon turning around, an innocent white transparent boy with a patchwork heart sewn into his chest appears. Once having been noticed, he does a hop animation, and  few notes of a soft sweet music box play before he gives his dialect/

(Box 10): Ghost boy: “Miss... Hey, miss... 3.1 is in trouble! Please... Save her. With a soul as pure as yours paired with 3.1, there may be hope in this wasteland.”

(Box 11): Ghost boy: “Don’t worry, I’ll help guide you and warn you about danger ahead.”

(Box 12): {Box fills large portion of screen and a discovery sound effect noise is activated}: /New Objective: Find Experiment 3.1/

[AS] = /The Ghost Boy transforms into a blue-white orb and disappears through the threshold of the room. The player follows the orb back into the main area/

[AS] = /The player follows the orb to a doorway blocked off by beams of wood. With the blue orb now illuminating a circle of limited light around it, you can put away your flashlight and take out the Rusty Pipe from your inventory to knock the beams of rotting wood down/

[AS] /The player must follow the white orb through a series of large pipes in the next room over, as the floor is missing, leaving potential dangerous gaps in between the pipes that the player could fall through. The orb moves faster than the player, so the pipes that you must follow on are limited to see by the player, encouraging the player to move quickly through the room/

(White text without box): [appears in the middle of the screen introducing the player to the sprint option]

[AS]: = The very last pipe the player meets must be sprinted through, as it shakes while the player steps onto it, and given a limited amount of time to keep their weight on it before it falls and sends the player back to the checkpoint

[AS] = Once reaching the next room, the orb does a bell chime and a box appear warning the player of danger up ahead. In this room, The player must face mechanical rats dubbed “Lab Rats” that emit an artificial hiss when taking damage. This weak enemy is defeated with two strikes of the Rusty Pipe, and can reduce 5 PH out of 50 PH in total {PH can be lengthened later on}

[AS] = Once the 3 enemies are defeated, teaching the player mechanics for combat, the player can move on with following the orb into another room. The room is half deteriorated, and pipes jutting out from the wall on the other side of the room are visible. On one of those pipes, 3.1 is hanging by the back of her hood, unconscious. A television with static produces a faint white glow, and the sound of static with the gentle tune of background music proceeds to meet the player’s ears

(Box 13): Ghost Boy: “This isn’t good... She could fall at any second!”

(Box 14): Ghost Boy: “You... Wouldn’t happen to be able to reach that far, would you?”

[AS] = The player is free to roam the room, and near the static television, there is a desk with elixirs in vials littering the desk, along with stacks of paperwork. The player is given the option to /inspect/

[AS] = The television fills the screen, and an animatic/animation of an old time tune in black and white white cutesy old time styled cartoon people fill the screen. A title appears and reads /It’s not magic... It’s science!/. A scene proceeds to follow, showing scientists in the form of the old time style cartoon drinking elixirs and being granted with temporary magic-like abilities such as breathing fire, breathing underwater, and growing wings. The clip ends with a scientist giving a thumbs up and a crowd of people praising him with smiles and cheers with the words /Making sure humanity will be saved by the real heroes/. For a brief second, text scrolls across the screen saying: products most definitely NOT tested on children—keep away from them to ensure their safety. Do not use products if pregnant, depressed, anxious, ill, prone to seizures—and most definitely don’t use if you’re the hope for humanity.

Suddenly, an angry face of cartoon scientist pops up in the middle of the screen, followed by a few more angry scientist faces in each corner of the screen.

/We know you’re watching this... Back off, kiddo. Your help is... Unnecessary/

[AS] = With that, a singular cartoon eye appears in the middle of the now static screen and the pipes around it look like spider limbs as it attempts to pry itself off the wall it’s mantled onto

(Box 15): Ghost Boy: “Danger, danger!”

[AS] = The gentle tune of music suddenly morphs into combat music. Ashira must use her Rusty Pipe to smash the screen of the old television in before it gets the chance to pry itself from the wall. After having done this, the music changes back to the gentle music playing before and the player is now able to inspect the vials on the desk. One is labeled as /wings/. The player is able to take this vial out of their inventory and drink it.

(Box 16): (... The concoction in the vial graces Ashira’s tastebuds with a light and saccharine taste reminiscent of caramel—a taste that compliments the reddish brown that churned within the vial)

[AS] = A small box appears on the top right hand side of the screen, showing the player has 15 seconds of using bird wings that they had sprouted in order to fly over the abyss in order to grab 3.1 and fly her to safety.

[AS] = Upon setting 3.1 down, she stirs and awakens

(Box 17): 3.1: “...”

(Box 18): 3.1: “You... Saved me?”

(Box 19): 3.1: “I... I don’t understand why would anyone—”

(Box 20): Ashira: “—Because”

[AS] = Ashira scoops 3.1 up into a hug

(Box 21): Ashira: “3.1... You matter. Even though those terrible people you were surrounded made you seem like you didn’t.”

(Box 22): (3.1 sniffles, a single tear rolling down her chubby cheek)

(Box 23): Ashira: “And, hey... Now you have a handy dandy... Well... /Hand/ to wipe away your tears like you wanted...”

(Box 24): (Ashira bats away the single tear rolling down 3.1’s cheek)

(Box 25): Ashira: “And... History won’t be repeated. Because now, it can be caaalled... Hm... /Thistory/! It’ll be happier, and filled with the story of the pure-of-heart rather than a dumb old /History/. I promise—“

[AS] = (3.1 cuts Ashira off with a warm, tearful embrace in return to Ashira’s as she chimes the following:)

(Box 26): “Thank you, thank you, thank you, Ashira... You’re like the older sister I never had.”

[AS] = (Upon 3.1’s rapid scrambling jostle to embrace Ashira back, a news paper clipping fluttered out of her pocket and landed on the floor. The player is given the option to inspect it)

(Box 27): (The paper has a bolded title with the name /Gilbert/... The rest of the writing is intangible.)

(Box 28): Ashira: “Gilbert...”

(Box 29): 3.1: “...”

(Box 30): 3.1: “Huh...?”

(Box 31): (Ashira pauses, staring down the bolded word printed onto the gray, frayed piece of paper, and then blinks, glancing at 3.1 with a gentle smile)

(Box 32): Ashira: “I... Think Gilbert fits you more than 3.1...”

(Box 33): 3.1: “I... That name... It sounds familiar, but I just can’t grasp it...”

(Box 34): 3.1: “... Could it really be /my/ name...? I... Don’t remember pocketing that slip of paper.”

(Box 35): Ashira: “There’s a pretty good chance of that.”

(Box 36): Gilbert: “Hm... Gilbert... I think I could get used to that. I... I’ve never had a real name before... None of us have.”

(Box 37): (The laboratory groans and rumbles slightly)

[AS] = (The Ghost Boy transforms into his physical form once again)

(Box 38): Ghost Boy: “Time runs short... The spectral children of this old facility can’t support the main beams of this place for much longer. Come, we must hurry if you two will make it out alive.”

(Box 39): Ashira: “You mean to say—“

(Box 40): Ghost Boy: “I cannot explain any further. Ashira, Gilbert... I’ll lead the way out. Just know that I... Would appreciate it if you return to this crumpled old facility someday to restore the hearts of many more children whom weren’t so lucky.”

(Box 41): (The Ghost Boy nods to Gilbert)

(Box 42): Ghost Boy: “Gilbert and I were... Different. However, I... Only made it so far. But, you—Ashira and Gilbert... I have faith in you two. Your compassion welling within the pique of your souls is remarkable.”

(Box 43): Ghost Boy: “Ashira is right, Gilbert... There is hope for humanity. And it starts with /Thistory/...”

[AS] The building rumbles once more and a large pipe clangs to the floor next to Gilbert and Ashira

(Box 44): Ghost Boy: “We must act quickly, now...! Follow me!”

[AS] Ashira picks Gilbert up and puts her on her shoulders, and the player must follow the Ghost Boy in the form of a blue orb once again out to the pipe area. Once entering this area, the player must hurry across the shaky pipe once more, causing it to fall and then follow the blue orb back to the main area. Upon arrival, a ladder crafted from pipes is now propped up against the wall, leading back up to the crumpled asphalt level of the collapsed upper floor of the laboratory.

(Box 45): Ghost Boy: “I let the other ghost children know that you would need something like this while you went on your way to save Gilbert, Ashira... Now, quickly! You must leave. The others’ power to sustain this structure has nearly fizzled out.”

(Box 46): Ghost Boy: “But please... Don’t forget about us...”

(Box 47): Ashira: “...”

(Box 48): Ashira: “I won’t... That’s a promise.”

[AS] (The player climbs up the ladder with Gilbert still clinging on to Ashira’s shoulders. Once reaching the surface, Gilbert hops down and remains at the player’s side—she is notably only half the size of Ashira’s model.)

[AS] (The laboratory caves in on itself once Ashira and Gilbert are safely standing before the crumbling structure, leaving a large, seemingly bottomless square crevice in the ground. A few floating multicolored orbs drift around the top of the pit, promising a new objective to take place there later on in the game)

(Box 49): /Objective completed: Find experiment 3.1/

(Box 50): /New Objective: {Coming Soon}/
